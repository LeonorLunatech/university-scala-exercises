Chapter 2 - First steps in Scala
===
These are the exercises for Chapter 2. Each exercise has its own file, and is written as a comment at the top of the file.

The first exercise is already completed as an example. You can run it with

    scala exercise1.scala

This should print the following output:

    Hello, Lunatech!

For the remaining exercises, add your solution to the file. When you are done, commit the changes, push them to your repository and show them to your teacher.
