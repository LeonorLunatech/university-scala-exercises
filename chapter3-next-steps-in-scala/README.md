Chapter 3 - Next steps in Scala (plus Intro to SBT)
===
These are the exercises for Chapter 3.

The chapter contains two sets of exercises.

 * `1-basics` contains exercises similar to the exercises from the previous chapter. Each exercise is in its own file. You run the exercises with the `scala` command.

 * `2-sbt-basics` contains exercises in the README.md file in that directory. Follow the instructions in that file.

 * `3-collections`: these exercises are in a different format. They require `sbt` to build them and run them. After solving the `2-sbt-basics` exercises, this should be a walk in the park. Here, multiple exercises are contained in the main source files of a single sbt project. Each exercise also contains automated tests, which help you verify that your solution is correct. To get started, go into the directory, and run `sbt test`. This should give you output indicating that many tests failed. Now, find the exercises in the sources and start working on them from top to bottom, until you have done them all and all tests are passing.

When you are done, commit the changes, push them to your repository and show them to your teacher.
